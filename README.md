# DMLD-Dataset
## Introduction
The frequent occurrence of landslides poses a serious threat to people’s lives and property. In order to evaluate disaster hazards based on remote sensing images via machine learning means, it is es-sential to establish an image database with manually labeled boundaries of landslides. However, the existing datasets do not cover diverse types of mountainous landslides. To address this issue, we propose a high-resolution (1 m) diverse mountainous landslide remote sensing dataset (DMLD), including 990 landslide instances across different terrain in southwestern China. To evaluate the performance of the DMLD, seven state-of-the-art deep learning models with different loss functions were implemented on it. The experiment results demonstrate not only that all of these deep learning methods with different characteristics can adapt well to the DMLD, but also that the DMLD has potential adaptability to other geographical regions.
